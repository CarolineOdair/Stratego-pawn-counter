# Stratego Pawn Counter

Project created as an extension to Stratego on www.stratego.io. The app keeps track of the pawns you and your opponent have in real time play so you can see both playersâ€™ pawn quantity and type without counting it in mind or on piece of paper. My first project with PyQt5 toolkit.
